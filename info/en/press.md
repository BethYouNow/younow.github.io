“The new show, which will stream live on YouNow each Wednesday at 6 p.m. Eastern time, is hosted by Jackie Oshry, the Huffington Post’s associate social media editor. Huffington Post has tested eight episodes to date and has already garnered 17,000 fans on YouNow. Initially, the plan was to run each episode for 30 minutes, but test episodes have run closer to an hour, as fans have remained highly engaged throughout the shows, said Ms. Oshry.”
