## Notification of Infringement

It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In addition, we will block without notice the accounts of users determined by us to be "repeat infringers”. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any content hosted on the YouNow service infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA”) by providing YouNow's Designated Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (please consult your legal counsel or see 17 U.S.C. Section 512(c)(3) to confirm these requirements):

- A physical or electronic signature of the owner or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
- Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works on the YouNow service are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works.
- Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit YouNow to locate the material. **Providing a broadcaster's profile URL and the date of such broadcast at which you believe there has been an infringement is the best way to help us locate content quickly.**
- Information reasonably sufficient to permit YouNow to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and an E-mail address at which you may be contacted.
- A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
- A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
