## FAQs for Partners

To help with communication with our partners, the following outlines questions that our partners frequently ask. They should be posted on the site and app in a place that’s only shared with YouNow partners. 

**I. General YouNow Partner Questions**

**II. Partner Payment Questions**

**III. Questions for Internal Reference**


### I. General YouNow Partner Questions:

1. What are "bars"?
 * Bars are the YouNow currency. Your fans buy bars and use them to purchase premium gifts that help them further engage with broadcasters and stand out from the crowd. 

2. How do I earn money?
 * You earn money during your broadcasts when you receive bars from the four bar-based gifts (see more details below). 
 
3. What gifts can people buy with bars?
 * There are four gifts that users can buy with bars: 
 
    a. 50-Likes - helping the broadcaster trend 
    
    b. Fan Mail - a personalized note that stands out in the chat 
    
    c. Marriage Proposal -  include picture of sender. No commitments here!  
    
    d. Bars - directly supporting Partner earnings with 50 to 10,000 bars 

4. Can any YouNow broadcaster receive the four bar-based gifts?
 * All YouNow broadcasters can receive the 50-Likes, Fan Mail and the Marriage Proposal. However, only Partners receive bars from the blue tip jar. Additionally, only Partners earn revenue when receiving these four bar-based gifts. 

5. How much do I earn from the gifts?
 * At the end of your broadcast, a screen will pop up outlining your total estimated earnings. Your total earnings will depend on the number of gifts you’ve received throughout your broadcast. Therefore, the more engaged your viewers are, the more you earn. 
 
6. What is Fan Mail and how does it work?
 * Viewers can send you Fan Mail during your broadcast. It is an opportunity for them to send you a personalized note that is displayed across the live chat for everyone to see. This is an opportunity for your fans to really get your attention. As a broadcaster, you have to “accept” the fan mail when you receive it in order for it to be displayed (and in order to receive the revenue from it). It is highly recommended to read the Fan Mail out loud to viewers, encouraging their engagement.

7. What determines my five Top Fans?
 * During every broadcast there is a list of your “Top Fans.” These are viewers who’ve given you the most amount of bar-based gifts out of all your fans during that specific broadcast. Next to the Top Fans’ names there is an indication of how many bars they’ve given you during this specific broadcast. 
 
8. Where can I find my Top Fans?
 * During a broadcast, the Top Fans are displayed right above the chat; they rotate accordingly depending on the total bars the fan has purchased.
 * When your top fans are interacting in the chat, their names will pop up with a small
	crown icon - so you can easily see who your biggest supporters are during your
	broadcast.
