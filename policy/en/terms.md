## Welcome

Welcome to the YouNow Service, located at www.younow.com (the "Site") and available as a mobile application (the "App"). The YouNow Service and any related services, aspects, functions, software platforms or derivatives thereof (collectively, the "Service") were created by YouNow ("YouNow", "we", "us" or "our") as a source of personal communication and entertainment, and the following YouNow Terms of Use (the "Terms") constitute a set of rules by which we operate them.

As you probably know by now, the Service is a self-promotion live-video social entertainment platform. YouNow allows anyone from anywhere to broadcast their live video (via webcam or mobile device), to be viewed - IN REAL TIME - by an online audience and followers and fans.

By using or accessing the Service, you acknowledge that you agree and are subject to the Terms, as well as to our [Privacy Policy](/policy/en/privacy). While they say a lot more, the basic idea of the Terms is that while we will take responsibility of what we have created, we ask that you take responsibility for anything you contribute to our platform whether as a content creator or as a viewer. In addition, much like in real life, we ask that you treat others with respect, do not use our platform for anything that would be deemed illegal or obscene, always remember the Golden Rule ("do unto others...") and most importantly - have fun. See our [Frequently Asked Questions page](https://younow.zendesk.com/forums/20597213-basics-of-younow) for further information about how you can use the Service.

YouNow hereby grants you permission to access and use the Service provided that you comply with these Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE FULLY BOUND BY ANY AND ALL OF THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE. Please note that we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to revise modify or change or remove portions or all of these, at any time. While we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to the Terms you should nonetheless periodically review them to make sure you comply. You should read through all the Terms carefully as they constitute a legally binding agreement between you and us.

## Registration

In order to access some features of the Service, and to be able to submit Content (as defined below) as a performer, you will have to create a YouNow account via your Facebook®, Google+, or Twitter account, using the same information provided to one of these networks. You can alter such information by updating your Facebook®, Google+, or Twitter account (it will automatically update your YouNow account the next time you log in) by accessing your YouNow account options by logging into the Serice and clicking the "My Settings" at the top right of the site or by accessing your settings, available through your profile page within the App Accounts.

You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs through your account, so we urge you to keep your account password secure and to always log-off when leaving your computer or mobile device unattended. Although YouNow will not be liable for losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of YouNow or others due to such unauthorized use – so we strongly recommend notifying us immediately of unauthorized use of your account or of any related security breach. If for any reason you want to limit your children's access to this Site and/or App, there are a number of parental control protections, which are commercially available.

## Ownership of the service provided to you

The underlying platforms of the Service are either the proprietary property of YouNow or the proprietary property of our licensors or licensees. "YouNowTM" and other trademarks, slogans, service marks, trade names, and trademarks which appear via the Service are proprietary to YouNow. Except as expressly set forth herein, no right, license, or interest to such trademarks are generated or granted hereunder. You shall not remove or alter any copyright notice, trademark or other proprietary or restrictive notice or legend affixed to any material provided by YouNow. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, no license is granted to you and no rights are conveyed by virtue of accessing or using the Service. All rights not granted under these Terms are reserved by YouNow.

You acknowledge and agree that nothing in these Terms shall have the effect of transferring the ownership of any copyrights, trademarks, slogans, service marks, trade names, trade dress or other proprietary rights contained within the Service or its Content or any part thereof to you or any third party nor to authorize you to create derivative works based on Content you do not own.

The Service may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by YouNow. YouNow has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, YouNow will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly relieve YouNow from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.

## User generated content

The term "Content" as used within these Terms refers to any, action, information, data, communication, video, text, software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, audiovisual combinations, interactive features and/or other materials you may view on, access through, or contribute to the Service. YouNow is not responsible for the Content of third parties. If you choose to contribute Content to the Service:

- Rest assured that the ownership to such Content remains with its original owner, and YouNow will not claim any ownership or control over such Content. 
- You shall be solely responsible for your own Content and the consequences of submitting and publishing the Content through the Service. 
- You are affirming, representing, and warranting that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to publish Content you submit; 
- You understand that the Service is intended for public use and not private communications, and you have no expectation of privacy with regard to any communication you might make or Content you may submit through the Service. Furthermore, you are aware that YouNow cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose via the Service and any contribution is done at your own risk 
- You are granting YouNow a perpetual worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Service and YouNow's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You are furthermore granting each user of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these Terms. 
- You agree to be solely liable for your Content and all materials and information contained in it. You hereby waive any moral rights that you may have in your Content in favor of YouNow and anyone acting with the authorization of YouNow. 
- By participating on the Site or within the App and/or accessing the Service, you consent to YouNow's and its agents' and designees' use of your name, Facebook ID, Twitter handle, Google+ ID, profile pictures, image, likeness, photograph and any other attributes of your persona in any and all media now known or hereafter developed, including but not limited to the Internet (including on the Site and on third party social media websites) and mobile applications, worldwide, in perpetuity, without additional payment, compensation or further notification to or permission from you, except where prohibited by law, or by the terms and conditions of any applicable websites 
- YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU DOWNLOAD OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN THE MATERIAL AND/OR DATA THROUGH THE USE OF THE APP AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF SUCH MATERIAL OR DATA 

You shall be solely responsible for your Content and expressly agree that your Content will not be: (1) defamatory, libelous, abusive, or obscene, including, without limitation, include material which encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, federal, or international law; (2) infringe on the copyright or any other proprietary right of any third-party; (3) invade the privacy of any other person; (4) contain a virus, worm, Trojan horse, time bomb, or any other harmful program or component; or (5) be otherwise inappropriate or unlawful. YOUNOW DOES NOT REPRESENT, WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THE TRUTHFULNESS, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY OF ANY OF THE USER CONTENT TRANSMITTED.

You also agree that you will not (i) use the Service to spam others or create mass-emails, (ii) continue harmful behavior if you have been warned of such; (iii) use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the YouNow servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser, and/or (iv) create a false identity or forged email address or header, or in any other way attempt to mislead others as to the identity of the sender or the origin of the message.

You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service (e.g., comments, email) for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Service with respect to their Content.

## Virtual currency/in-service purchases

You understand that while, at times, you may "buy" or "purchase" (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual bars, for use in the Service; or (b) virtual in-Service items, including but not limited to fan mail and engagement rings/proposals, 50 thumbs up, tipping (together with virtual currency, "Virtual Items"), these real world terms are only being used as shorthand. You do not in fact "own" the Virtual Items, and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, YouNow grants you a limited license to use the Service, including software programs that may manifest themselves as these items.

The purchase of Virtual Items is a completed transaction upon YouNow's confirmation that you have redeemed iTunes Wallet credits or any other third party virtual currency. Any virtual currency balance shown in your YouNow account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license to the Virtual Items within the Service. You will not be able to sell Virtual Items in exchange for virtual or real currency credited back to your YouNow account, nor will you be able to receive a refund of virtual or real currency for Virtual Items (including any virtual currency), including if your access to the Site and/or App has been suspended, limited or terminated pursuant to these Terms.

Your gift of certain Virtual Items to a performer on the Service may, but will not necessarily, appear in the chat feed of the Content you are viewing. However, for certain high-value Virtual Items purchased with YouNow Bars (such as, but not limited to an engagement ring/proposal), such gift(s) will be displayed individually in the chat feed of the applicable Content, and should such a gift fail to be displayed individually, you will be credited the amount paid for such Virtual Item(s) to your YouNow account. Purchase of the "Chat Now" privilege during high-traffic broadcasts will give you the opportunity to rejoin a chat feed that has become over-full and to remain in the chat feed for the remainder of the broadcast. Purchasers of "Chat Now" will receive priority over users who are participating in the chat feed for free.

Tips and other Virtual Items gifted to performers may result in some revenue to such performers, as determined in YouNow's sole discretion; however, YouNow makes no guarantee that the amount or value of the bars or Virtual Items you may give a performer will correlate to the revenue such performer may receive from YouNow.

## Right to shut down, deny or limit access, remove content

YouNow has the right, but not the obligation, to screen, refuse to post, remove or edit the Content, at any time and for any or no reason at all, at our sole discretion. YouNow takes steps to monitor Content and keep the Site, App, and Service safe, but YouNow cannot guarantee their safety. You enter the Site and/or App and use the YouNow Service at your own risk. YouNow reserves the right, but assumes no obligation, to remove Content, which is abusive, illegal or disruptive, or that otherwise fails to comply with these Terms, and to limit or revoke your access in full or in part to the Service, in our sole discretion, at any time, and for any reason, including, but not limited to reasons such as technical difficulties or violation of these Terms.

In addition to any right or remedy that may be available to YouNow under these Terms or applicable law, YouNow expressly reserves the right to suspend, limit or terminate your access to the Site and/or the App, at any time with or without notice and with or without cause, including if YouNow determines, in YouNow's sole discretion, that you pose a threat to the Site or its users. In addition, YouNow may refer any information on illegal activities, including your identity, to the proper authorities.

Given that the Service is provided in real-time - we would appreciate your help in reporting to us any Content that you believe violates these Terms. Please direct the relevant information, including the IP address used to commit the alleged violation and the date and time of the alleged violation, including the time zone to [support.younow.com](https://younow.zendesk.com/home).

YouNow will process any notices of alleged copyright infringement and will take appropriate actions under the DMCA.

YouNow may notify the owner or administrator of the affected Content so that he or she can make a counter-notification pursuant to his or her rights under the DMCA. If you receive such a notice, you may provide counter-notification in writing to YouNow's designated agent (the "Designated Agent") that includes the information below. To be effective, the counter-notification must be a written communication that includes the following:

- Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; 
- A statement from you under the penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and 
- Your name, physical address and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of a Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your physical address is located, or if your physical address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which YouNow may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of allegedly infringing material or an agent of such person. 

Notices of claimed infringement and counter-notifications should be directed to the Designated Agent by mailing all required documentation to: YouNow, 25 W. 36th Street, 5th Floor New York, NY 10018, ATTN: COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT DESIGNATED AGENT or by email to [feedback@younow.com](mailto:feedback@younow.com) with the words "Attn Copyright Infringement Designated Agent" in the subject line.
