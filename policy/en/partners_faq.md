## FAQs for Partners

To help with communication with our partners, the following outlines questions that our partners frequently ask. They should be posted on the site and app in a place that’s only shared with YouNow partners. 


**I. General YouNow Partner Questions**

**II. Partner Payment Questions**

**III. Questions for Internal Reference**



### I. General YouNow Partner Questions:

1. What are "bars"?
 * Bars are the YouNow currency. Your fans buy bars and use them to purchase premium gifts that help them further engage with broadcasters and stand out from the crowd. 

2. How do I earn money?
 * You earn money during your broadcasts when you receive bars from the four bar-based gifts (see more details below). 
 
3. What gifts can people buy with bars?
 * There are four gifts that users can buy with bars: 
 
   a. 50-Likes - helping the broadcaster trend 
    
   b. Fan Mail - a personalized note that stands out in the chat 
    
   c. Marriage Proposal -  include picture of sender. No commitments here!  
    
   d. Bars - directly supporting Partner earnings with 50 to 10,000 bars

4. Can any YouNow broadcaster receive the four bar-based gifts?
 * All YouNow broadcasters can receive the 50-Likes, Fan Mail and the Marriage Proposal. However, only Partners receive bars from the blue tip jar. Additionally, only Partners earn revenue when receiving these four bar-based gifts. 

5. How much do I earn from the gifts?
 * At the end of your broadcast, a screen will pop up outlining your total estimated earnings. Your total earnings will depend on the number of gifts you’ve received throughout your broadcast. Therefore, the more engaged your viewers are, the more you earn. 
 
6. What is Fan Mail and how does it work?
 * Viewers can send you Fan Mail during your broadcast. It is an opportunity for them to send you a personalized note that is displayed across the live chat for everyone to see. This is an opportunity for your fans to really get your attention. As a broadcaster, you have to “accept” the fan mail when you receive it in order for it to be displayed (and in order to receive the revenue from it). It is highly recommended to read the Fan Mail out loud to viewers, encouraging their engagement.

7. What determines my five Top Fans?
 * During every broadcast there is a list of your “Top Fans.” These are viewers who’ve given you the most amount of bar-based gifts out of all your fans during that specific broadcast. Next to the Top Fans’ names there is an indication of how many bars they’ve given you during this specific broadcast. 
 
8. Where can I find my Top Fans?
 * During a broadcast, the Top Fans are displayed right above the chat; they rotate accordingly depending on the total bars the fan has purchased.
 * When your top fans are interacting in the chat, their names will pop up with a small
	crown icon - so you can easily see who your biggest supporters are during your
	broadcast. 

9. How do I find out who my overall “Top Fans” are - not just for a specific broadcast?
 * To find the list of your overall “Top Fans,” go to your profile page and you’ll see the full list on the bottom right-hand corner; these fans have a crown image next to their name. Click here for more information on the “crown” feature.

10. How can I trend?
 * Broadcasters can trend more easily when they are using a hashtag for their broadcast that’s already trending (for example: #musicians). Chose a topic that best describes your content, this will help viewers find you who have the same interests as you.
 * Broadcasters and hashtags on YouNow trend by a combination of factors. This includes, but is not limited to:
    
   a. Total broadcast “likes”
    
    b. How quickly “likes” accumulate
    
     c. Broadcast activity (e.g., chat, gifts received, etc.)
    
      d. Viewers
    
       e. Broadcast length

11. How do I receive more bar-based gifts and “likes” from my viewers during a broadcast?
 * We don’t recommend explicitly asking your viewers for “likes” and bar-based gifts, but here are some tips to encourage gifting and liking:  
  
   a. In order to receive more “likes,” many of our partners will say “when we get to 1,000 likes, I’ll tell you a story,” or “I’ll sing the song the top fan asks for.”
  
    b. Any time you receive a bar-based gift, thank them/give them a shout-out. Ultimately, your viewers are looking for your attention, so the more you acknowledge them, the more your viewers will want to give you gifts.   

12. What hashtag should I use when I broadcast?
 * Try to use hashtags that are relevant to your content (e.g., #dance, #musicians) and/or hashtags that are already trending. 
 * Note: When you’re using your own YouNow name as your hashtag, you will have less of an opportunity to trend within the YouNow community; you also won’t be able to inherit another broadcaster’s viewers who is using the same hashtag as you.   

13. How do I get my fans to spend more gifts on me?
 * Anytime you receive one of the four bar-based gifts (see above), give that fan a shout-out, as it encourages them to give you more. It also incentivizes your other fans to give you gifts because who wouldn’t want a shout-out from you?

14. How can I gain more YouNow viewers fans?
 * Ultimately, the better the content you create is, the more viewers and fans you’ll have. There are also a few tips that can help you gain more viewers and fans on YouNow:
  
   a. Add your YouNow profile link to your social media profiles (e.g., your YouTube banner and “About” page. To see how, click here.
  
    b. Promote your broadcasts on all your social media channels (e.g., YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Vine and Snapchat) and invite your friends to watch before you go live.
  
     c. Encourage your viewers to share your broadcast with their friends/followers. YouNow has a feature, where any viewer can share a broadcast in real-time to their Twitter, YouNow and Facebook fans. For more information, click here.  

15. How long should I broadcast for?
 * We recommend that partners broadcast for at least 30 minutes; many partners broadcast for longer times, but 30 minutes is a good benchmark - since this is a live stream, it takes time for viewers to accumulate and join the broadcast, so very short broadcasts will not enable you to utilize your full viewership potential (viewers who whould love to see you may only see your message indicating that you’re going live when you are 10 minutes into the broadcast). 
 * However, if you find yourself in an interesting location and you just want to give your fans a quick glance of a different side of you, feel free to broadcast for a shorter amount of time - the viewers that will make it to the broadcast would love that! 

16. When is a good time to go live?
 * For English-speaking partners, any time after 3pm PST/6pm EST during the week and then Saturdays and Sundays are good times to broadcast. Keep in mind that some of your fans may be living in a different timezone, so it’s worthwhile to think of the equivalent times in the respective time zones (e.g. if most of your audience is German, then after 6pm in Germany or during the weekend could work well). Nevertheless, if you find that this is an interesting moment and you fell like sharing it with your viewers, you should go live regardless of the time, and make sure you let them know about it through Twitter, Instagram or Facebook.  

17. What should my content focus on? 
 * You can focus on whatever content you’d like during your YouNow broadcasts! Many of our partners use YouNow as an extension of their content on other social media platforms. Try taking your broadcast outside your home to show your viewers your latest adventures. Try these outside-the-home content ideas (potentially with a selfie stick):
   
   a. Party/meet-and-greet/event

    b. Man-on-the-street interviews

     c. Concert

      d. Shopping
       
       e. Traveling 

        f. How you create your Vine/YouTube videos

 * Some content that our YouNow partners focus on includes, but is not limited to:

   a. Dancing
    
    b. Singing/playing an instrument
     
     c. Leading a Q&A session

      d. Interviews with friends

       e. Beauty/fashion tips
        
        f. Drawing/painting
         
         g. Playing games (e.g., Hangman, Pictionary)  

18. How do I receive a YouNow selfie-stick, t-shirt or other swag?

### II Partner Payment Questions: 

How do I know how much money I’ve earned?

At the end of every broadcast, you’ll receive an estimated summary of how much you’ve earned during that actual live stream.


How can I get paid? 

In order to receive payment, you have to complete a W9 form found here (United States citizens only) or a W8 form found here (international citizens only). All partners need to earn at least $100 in order to receive payments each month.

You can receive payment via PayPal (preferred), direct deposit (ACH) or wire transfer. Please share with us your payment details here.


When do I get paid and how often?

Partners are paid once a month at the beginning of every month if you’ve earned at least $100. YouNow will send you an email with your earnings for the previous month. For example: In the beginning of February, you’ll receive your earnings summary for your January earnings and will receive payment within 5 to 10 business days. The number of days it takes to receive earnings depends on your form of payment; PayPal is fastest).  


How do I get paid as fast as possible?

PayPal is the fastest form of payment. If we have your W8/W9 form and your payment details, that helps expedite the process.


How can I receive a summary of my earnings?

At the beginning of every month, YouNow will send you a summary of your earnings from the previous month via email.


Why do I have to complete a W8 or a W9 Form?

In order to receive payment, all YouNow Partners must complete one of the following so we can keep track of payments with all partners. 

1) W9 form for United States citizens only - click here to complete OR
2) A W8 form for international partners only - click here to complete


Why is my monthly total payment not the same as the total amount on my earnings page?

The estimated earnings shown to partners are an estimation of the actual earnings. Apple / Google takes a small percentages of your earnings from the bar-based gifts. 



 I’ve been paid, but I still have an outstanding balance on my “earnings” page. Why?

If you’ve been paid for your previous month’s earnings, the money displayed on your “earnings” page is most likely your revenue from the current month. Here’s an example: We paid you February 6th for your January earnings, but you still have $100 displayed on your “earnings” page. That’s because you likely broadcasted at the beginning of February and you earned $100 from February 1st through February 6th. 

 I still have a question about my payment and it’s not explained in the FAQ page, can you help?

Of course! If you have any payment questions, please send an email to partnerpayments@younow.com. 


If I am getting paid via PayPal, are there any fees for me?

There may be a small fee if you’re receiving a payment via PayPal; please note that we try to avoid these PayPal fees for you. 

You can review the PayPal policies directly on the site. 


If I am getting paid via wire transfer, are there any fees for me?

There may be a small fee if you’re receiving a wire transfer. The fee percentage depends on your bank.


If I would like to receive payment via a wire transfer or direct deposit (ACH), what information do I need to send you?

If you would like to receive payment via a wire transfer payment, please complete this form.


How do I change my preferred method of payment?

If you would like to change your preferred method of payment,  please complete this form and/or send an email to partnerpayments@younow.com. 


If I need to file my taxes, how do I receive a 1099 from YouNow?
